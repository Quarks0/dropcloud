DropCloud is a music based site influenced by SoundCloud built on a Rails/Redux framework.

## Features and Implementation

### Song listings and song creation tools



### User Pages



### Song Comments



## Future Directions for DropCloud

DropCloud still requires additional work. The main features that would need implementation include:

### Audio playback

The ability to play music is an essential feature of sharing music. Playback would be implemented through React Player, which would be nested at the bottom of the app at all times.

### Playlists and queues

Another feature of audio playback includes playlists and/or song queues to play multiple songs in a row. This feature would be implemented through the front end framework by allowing the react player to start a new song when a previous song is done playing.

### Search bar

A search function would allow users to find any songs, comments, and users within DropCloud. This feature would likely implement the react native search bar.
